# Ray-Tracer

Below is an example image showing off the major functionalities -- mirrored surfaces, textures with normal maps, specular highlights and diffuse lighting
All done from my code -- no libraries were used to assist the rendering process. Every pixel is solved via the math in my code using handwritten mathematics and Vector classes.
